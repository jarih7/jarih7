Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is JÃ¡ra and I'm an Apple and all-around IT enthusiast. I studied web and software engineering at [FIT CTU](https://fit.cvut.cz/en). The studies have helped me discover the vast array of domains hidden behind the term "IT". I'm currently interested in web development and native app development ðŸ“± for iOS.

For my bachelor's thesis, I created a Node.js package [grades-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grades-sdk) that provided an easy way of communication with [Grades](https://grades.fit.cvut.cz) â€“ a classification application used by a number of courses at FIT CTU â€“ to any Node.js applications via Grades' REST API.

ðŸ“§ The best way to reach me is via e-mail at [hampejsjaroslav@icloud.com](mailto:hampejsjaroslav@icloud.com).
