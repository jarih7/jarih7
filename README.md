I'm an Apple and all-around IT enthusiast. I studied web and software engineering at [FIT CTU](https://fit.cvut.cz/en). The studies have helped me discover the vast array of domains hidden behind the term "IT". I'm currently interested in web development and native app development ðŸ“± for iOS.

For my bachelor's thesis, I created [grades-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grades-sdk), a Node.js package that provides simple way of communication with [Grades](https://grades.fit.cvut.cz) â€“ application used at FIT CTU for storage and management of data regarding the courses and the students â€“ to any Node.js application via Grades' REST API.

I have recently peeked into the world of iOS app development. My first attempts have so far resulted in an app called [koin](https://github.com/jarih7/koin). It is a work in progress with the intention of gaining some experience and getting to know the SDK.
